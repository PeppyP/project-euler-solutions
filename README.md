# Project Euler Solutions

> :stop_sign: **This repo contains very explicit hints for programming problems that are useful for improving your skills.** Don't spoil things for yourself without giving it a serious try. :stop_sign:


A collection of answers for Project Euler problems completed by members of the Churchie Coding Club 

## Description:
solutions.md contains solutions for all of the Project Euler we, as the Churchie Coding club, have completed. Each listed problem contains the solution method and it's explanation. Most of the problems are either solved in C++ or in Python, and some problems may be solved without using any code.

## What is Project Euler?
Named after famed mathematician Leonhard Euler and found at projecteuler.net, Project Euler is a set of mathematics problems that are (typically) unsolvable without the use of programming. While mathematical skills will help you find solution methods, programming skills will be required to produce solutions with small time complexities due to the scale of most problems.

## Doesn't this enable/encourage cheating?
Yes, of course placing solutions online gives cheaters the ability to copy them in order to get Project Euler points. However, the goal of Project Euler, and of competative programming in general is to improve your programming and logic skills, not to increase your number of magic beans. A ["passionate" blog post by Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133949) details this pretty well, but I'll just add that easy solutions to existing problems are omnipresent. Even just liberal use of Google allows anyone with basic coding knowledge, reading comprehesion, and time to solve 90% of problems. Furthermore, cheating at Project Euler doesn't give you much; if you use it for your resume for Uni or a job, you will quickly be confronted by problems that cannot be solved by lazy methods either because they're being conducted in an exam hall or because they are real-world issues that don't have descriptions or existing solutions (your app's access keys got spoofed and now real money is being lost for every second you fail to terminate it and mount backups). Anyway, I won't be providing the number for each problem, but instead my logic and thinking for each problem, and some code. So, while anyone could easily use this to determine the answer it at least won't make it easy for copy-paste bots.
